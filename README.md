My first videogame done in Python.

Date: May 2016

It's all in Slovak, even the code. - Still considering if it's worth translating in English.

It's 2D shooter with few levels including boss and bonus levels.

I tried to make it as object-oriented as possible.

It's not perfect as it was done as final school project and after that I didn't bother to edit in anymore.
